# Task-Oriented-Semantic-Communications

Code for Paper *Intelligent task-oriented semantic communication method in artificial intelligence of things* published in Journal on Communications<br />


1 “ResNet18_CAM.py” is used to generate semantic importance ranking<br />
2 “mi_estimators.py” is used to estimate mutual information<br />
3 “MI+Classification_resnet.py” and “resnet_10_classes_channel.py” are the training code for considering and not considering mutual information between the channel input and output in the loss, respectively<br />
4 “classification_crop.py” is used to compress semantics<br />
5 “classification_test_resnet.py” is the test code<br />
“resnet18-5c106cde.pth” is the inital parameters of Resnet18<br />
